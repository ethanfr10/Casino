This project was a Casino that I made when I was a Junior in High School. Originally the project was to make a blackjack game for my sophomore year final project in APCSA, however I decided to add a Roulette game and a Texas Hold'em game my Junior year for fun. The Casino does not have graphics as I did not know how to do that at the time, but it is interactive and works through multiple rounds of the game, keeping track of all the money bet and what your current amount is.
